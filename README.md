# EUG STHLM - 99 Erlang Problems (Part 1)

99 Erlang problems to be solved at the Erlang User Group meet-up in Stockholm.

The list of problems to be tackled in the first session can be found [here](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/1_to_10).

A tentative solution to these exercises will eventually be made available [here](https://github.com/efcasado/EUGSTHLM-99erlproblems/tree/pt1-sol)

Note that the project ships with a `Makefile`, meaning that it can be built by simply issuing `make`.
Similarly, you can run the provided unit tests running `make tests`. You can also do it all at once
with `make all test`.
